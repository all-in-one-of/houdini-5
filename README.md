## /hda - digital assets

### Merge maps RGB

Allows merging of up to 3 images into a single color attrib (one image per
channel). Each channel provides the same customization options as "Attrib from
Map" SOP.

### PTF (Parallel Transport Frames)

<small>Tags: VEX, curves, polygons</small>

Sweeps profile shape along one or multiple curves. Use multiple instances for
recursive application. Parameters for twisting, radius modulation ramp,
multiple generation modes: curves, tube, disc. Includes Help page w/ further
details.

### Phyllotaxis

<small>Tags: Python, points</small>

Point generator for phyllotaxis patterns

### SVG polygon import

<small>Tags: Python, polygons</small>

Imports first `<polygon>` element from given SVG file. No SVG transforms are
supported. No 3rd party deps required.

### Tessellations

<small>Tags: Python, polygons</small>

Recursive face tessellations: tri fan, quad fan, edge split triangles. An
optional displacement amount can be specified for the latter two modes.

## /hip - scenes

### DeJong

<small>Tags: OpenCL, simulation, points</small>

![](assets/dejong.jpg)

Uses an OpenCL kernel to compute the 2D DeJong strange attractor w/ 3 million
particles, then applies a second kernel to perform stereographic transformation
to 3D.

### DLA

<small>Tags: VEX, simulation, points</small>

![](assets/dla.jpg)

VEX simulation of Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA), supports various params
to control growth. Sim uses an initial set of seed particles, then each frame
spawns a fixed number of new particles in the vicinity of existing points. Each
particle has a selection probability attrib, which decays each time the
particle is used as growth source. Once that probability is less than
configured threshold the particle is ignored as source for new growth.

This implementation is based on the approach taken in [toxiclibs](http://toxiclibs.org/2010/02/new-package-simutils/). For an alternative approach, see [Entagma](http://www.entagma.com/vex-in-houdini-diffusion-limited-aggregation-plus-rendering-in-mantra-redshift/).

### Dipole fieldlines

<small>Tags: VEX, simulation, curves</small>

![](assets/dipoles.jpg)

VEX field line simulation between randomly charged dipoles. Takes an input
geometry, and spawns a configurable number of agents in a disc around each
point. These agents are then attracted/repelled by other poles in the field.
Each agent's trajectory is stored in individual polylines. Agents are removed
from the sim (not updated further) once they've reached another pole.
